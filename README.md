# Cherry-Blossom-Predictions

These predictions represent an attempt to approach a familiar problem with deliberate simplicity and a slightly unconventional perspective. Rather than fitting a lasso or GAM model, I focused on specific daily temperatures and the broader patterns and fluctuations they form over time. Many existing approaches rely on cumulative temperature measures beginning at the start of the calendar year or following the final winter frost. In contrast, my method does not aggregate temperatures into a single running total; instead, it compares entire temperature sequences and evaluates similarity between years.

The model operates by matching observed and forecasted 2026 daily maximum temperatures to their closest historical counterparts across multiple locations. For each of the five sites under prediction, I identified the ten historical years, drawn from any available site, with the smallest average daily temperature difference relative to 2026. The final bloom-date prediction is then calculated as the mean bloom date across those ten most similar years. To reduce the risk of spurious matches, I excluded years with insufficient data coverage, ensuring that similarity was assessed on a reasonably complete temperature sequence.

The method is intentionally straightforward and, admittedly, unlikely to be optimal in its current form. However, its simplicity is part of its conceptual appeal. By treating each year’s temperature trajectory as a holistic pattern rather than reducing it to cumulative metrics or fitted coefficients, the approach reframes bloom prediction as a problem of analog matching. To the best of my knowledge, this sequence-similarity framework is relatively uncommon in this context, which lends it a degree of novelty. That novelty is important: even if the model’s predictive accuracy proves modest, it introduces an alternative lens through which to think about phenological forecasting. Innovation in modeling does not always arise from increased complexity; sometimes it emerges from reinterpreting the structure of the data itself. Exploring such alternative representations may uncover dynamics that cumulative or parametric methods overlook, and it opens the door to hybrid approaches that blend statistical rigor with pattern recognition.

Whether the resulting predictions are excellent, mediocre, or catastrophically misguided, the underlying idea offers substantial room for refinement. Incorporating data from a broader range of sites could strengthen the matching process and improve robustness. Assigning greater weight to more recent years, or experimenting with other weighting schemes, may also enhance performance. Additionally, identifying which portions of the seasonal trajectory carry the most predictive signal, recognizing, for instance, that early January temperatures likely matter far less than those in mid-March, could further sharpen the method. In this sense, the current model is less a finished product than a proof of concept, with meaningful potential for expansion and improvement.
